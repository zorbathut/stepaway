Tired of your doctors using the wrong medicine entirely?

This lets you set global defaults for colonists, friendlies, and enemies, plus different options for humans and animals. Never waste your glitterworld medicine again!

Does not require a new save game - this can be transparently added and removed from any savegame you already have. Note that adding it will not automatically change settings globally (but there's a button for that) and that removing it from a game will delete your default medicine preferences; you'll have to reset them if you choose to re-add the mod.
